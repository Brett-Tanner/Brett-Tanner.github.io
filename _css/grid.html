<p>
  <code
    >grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(min(200px, 100%),
    1fr));</code

  is a handy property for creating a grid with responsive columns.

<p>
  If your grid is overflowing the container, try setting the problem columns to
  <code>minmax(0, whatever)</code>, so their min width isn't auto
