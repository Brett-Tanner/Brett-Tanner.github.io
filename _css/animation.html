<h1 id="transforms">Transforms</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    Take one or more CSS transform functions as values, with those functions
    taking their own value, usually an angle or number
  </li>
  <li>
    Can be applied to almost all elements, exceptions being col, colgroup and
    inline elements that aren't replaced (like <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, not
    like <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>)
  </li>
  <li>
    Cheaper compared to other animations as it
    <a href="https://web.dev/rendering-performance/#the_pixel_pipeline"
      >occurs during composition</a
    >
    and can be GPU accelerated if necessary.
    <a
      href="https://web.dev/stick-to-compositor-only-properties-and-manage-layer-count/"
      >Here</a
    >
    are some other properties which only affect composition.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="transforms/2d">2D Transforms</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Rotate
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rotates the element by a provided number of degrees, radians or
        fractions of a turn
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Scale
    <ul>
      <li>
        Takes two fractions, x first then y, and increases the element's size by
        that much
      </li>
      <li>
        Also has <code>scaleX()</code> and <code>scaleY()</code> variants which
        take only one fraction argument
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Skew
    <ul>
      <li>Takes two arguments, degrees or radians to skew in x then y-axis</li>
      <li>
        Also has <code>skewX()</code> and <code>skewY()</code> variants which
        take only one argument
      </li>
      <li>
        The base function can also accept only one argument, in which case it'll
        behave like <code>skewX()</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Translate
    <ul>
      <li>Changes the elements position by an amount in the x then y-axis</li>
      <li>
        Also has <code>translateX()</code> and
        <code>translateY()</code> variants which take only one argument
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  All of these can be chained by simply adding them to the transform property
  one after the other, with spaces between.
  <a href="https://codepen.io/bali_balo/post/chaining-transforms"
    >There is some debate on whether chained transforms should be read L > R or
    R > L</a
  >, but L > R makes sense to me.
</p>

<h2 id="transforms/3d">3D Transforms</h2>

<p>
  Kinda the same as 2D transforms, but with the addition of perspective (and
  another dimension of course).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-css-perspective-works/">Perspective</a>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Set on an element's parent container. If you want a 3d shape, you'll
        need to set the <code>transform-style: preserve-3d</code> property to
        transform all the child elements together, preserving their relative
        positions
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>transform-style</code> also might fix some weird
          <code>z-index</code> issues I've had before, it guarantees child
          elements will appear in the order they are in 3D space, not the order
          they are in the DOM
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Sets the distance from the user to the z=0 plane, which allows
        transformations on the z-axis to actually make a visible difference.
        Bigger values are further.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For translate, allows the element to get bigger as it moves closer and
          smaller as it moves further
        </li>
        <li>
          For rotate, the element looks like it's actually rotating rather than
          just shrinking and growing. Also briefly disappears at multiples of 90
          if element has no depth.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Must be declared first in the transform property, unlike other transform
        functions which can be in any order
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>perspective-origin</code> determines the angle you're looking at
        the element from
        <ul>
          <li>
            Default is centered, so if you move the element you'll see it moving
            relative to you
          </li>
          <li>
            But you can also move the perspective origin, allowing you to look
            around the element
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Rotate
    <ul>
      <li>
        Adds <code>rotateX()</code>, <code>rotateY()</code>,
        <code>rotateZ()</code> and
        <a
          href="https://www.quackit.com/css/functions/css_rotate3d_function.cfm"
          ><code>rotate3D()</code></a
        >
        functions.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Scale
    <ul>
      <li>
        Adds <code>scaleZ()</code> and <code>scale3D()</code> which scale the
        element in the z-axis and all 3 at once respectively
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Translate
    <ul>
      <li>
        Adds <code>translateZ()</code> and <code>translate3D()</code> which move
        the element on the z-axis and all 3. <code>translateZ()</code> will not
        do anything without perspective.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Matrix
    <ul>
      <li>
        Also exists as a way to combine really complex transforms together
      </li>
      <li>
        But generally avoided due to poor readability, don't use it unless you
        need it
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="transitions">
  <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions"
    >Transitions</a
  >
</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    Let you animate the transition between states of an element rather than
    instantly changing
  </li>
  <li><code>transition</code> is shorthand for:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>transition-property</code> - Determines the CSS property to be
      transitioned (e.g. background-color)
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>transition-duration</code> - Determines how long the transition
      takes from start to finish
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>transition-timing-function</code> - Determines the rate at which the
      transition progresses, has keywords like ease-out/ease-in but can also be
      defined manually
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>transition-delay</code> - Determines the delay before starting the
      transition after it's triggered
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    Multiple properties can be animated in a single line by separating them with
    commas
  </li>
  <li>
    Creates a new

    >. Performance is best when transitioning opacity or transform properties
  </li>
  <li class="text-danger">
    Try to avoid transitioning to or from an 'auto' value as it can cause
    unexpected behavior
  </li>
</ul>
