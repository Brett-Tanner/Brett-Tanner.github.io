  <ul>
    <li>
      Used when you need something more complicated than a transition can
      provide
      <ul>
        <li>
          they're designed to loop; transitions can but not designed for it
        </li>
        <li>
          transitions need a trigger like a pseudoclass or class being
          added/removed via JS, animations can run immediately if they're told
          to
        </li>
        <li>
          Animations are more flexible than a the
          <code>transition-timing-function</code> allows
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      You define animation properties on the element to be animated, then the
      keyframes in an @keyframes rule with the name given in
      <code>animation-name</code>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Animation Properties</h4>

  <p>
    Can also just use the <code>animation</code> property to set all at once.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, using the individual properties lets you
    <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations#setting_multiple_animation_property_values"
      >set a bunch of animations at once on the same element</a
    >
    using comma-separated lists of values
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>animation-name</code> - sets the name connecting this animation to
      its keyframes
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>animation-delay</code> - specifies delay between element loading and
      animation starting and/or whether the animation should start at the
      beginning/part way through
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>animation-duration</code> - the time taken to complete a full cycle
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>animation-fill-mode</code> - specifies how styles apply to the
      element after/before the animation. e.g. will it retain the styles after
      the animation completes? Start with the styles applied?
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>animation-iteration-count</code> - how many times the animation will
      loop. <code>infinite</code> is an accepted value
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>animation-direction</code> - decides if the animation will loop or
      jump back to the starting position at the end of a cycle
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>animation-play-state</code> - can pause or start the animation
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>animation-timing-function</code> - same as for transitions, sets how
      the animation progresses through each cycle
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Keyframes</h4>

  <pre>
@keyframes animation-name {
  from {
    background-color: red;
  }

  to {
    background-color: green;
  }
}</pre
  >

  <ul>
    <li>
      Can also use percentages to set keyframes at specific points other than
      the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> keywords
    </li>
    <li>
      both <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> are optional, if you leave one
      out the start/end state will be inferred from current styles
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h1 id="transforms">
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform"
      >Transforms</a
    >
  </h1>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Take one or more CSS transform functions as values, with those functions
      taking their own value, usually an angle or number
    </li>
    <li>
      Can be applied to almost all elements, exceptions being col, colgroup and
      inline elements that aren't replaced (like <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, not
      like <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>)
    </li>
    <li>
      Cheaper compared to other animations as it
      <a href="https://web.dev/rendering-performance/#the_pixel_pipeline"
        >occurs during composition</a
      >
      and can be GPU accelerated if necessary.
      <a
        href="https://web.dev/stick-to-compositor-only-properties-and-manage-layer-count/"
        >Here</a
      >
      are some other properties which only affect composition.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="transforms/2d">2D Transforms</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Rotate
      <ul>
        <li>
          Rotates the element by a provided number of degrees, radians or
          fractions of a turn
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Scale
      <ul>
        <li>
          Takes two fractions, x first then y, and increases the element's size
          by that much
        </li>
        <li>
          Also has <code>scaleX()</code> and <code>scaleY()</code> variants
          which take only one fraction argument
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Skew
      <ul>
        <li>
          Takes two arguments, degrees or radians to skew in x then y-axis
        </li>
        <li>
          Also has <code>skewX()</code> and <code>skewY()</code> variants which
          take only one argument
        </li>
        <li>
          The base function can also accept only one argument, in which case
          it'll behave like <code>skewX()</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Translate
      <ul>
        <li>Changes the elements position by an amount in the x then y-axis</li>
        <li>
          Also has <code>translateX()</code> and
          <code>translateY()</code> variants which take only one argument
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    All of these can be chained by simply adding them to the transform property
    one after the other, with spaces between.
    <a href="https://codepen.io/bali_balo/post/chaining-transforms"
      >There is some debate on whether chained transforms should be read L > R
      or R > L</a
    >, but L > R makes sense to me.
  </p>

  <h4 id="transforms/3d">3D Transforms</h4>

  <p>
    Kinda the same as 2D transforms, but with the addition of perspective (and
    another dimension of course).
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-css-perspective-works/"
        >Perspective</a
      >
      <ul>
        <li>
          Set on an element's parent container. If you want a 3d shape, you'll
          need to set the <code>transform-style: preserve-3d</code> property to
          transform all the child elements together, preserving their relative
          positions
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>transform-style</code> also might fix some weird
            <code>z-index</code> issues I've had before, it guarantees child
            elements will appear in the order they are in 3D space, not the
            order they are in the DOM
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Sets the distance from the user to the z=0 plane, which allows
          transformations on the z-axis to actually make a visible difference.
          Bigger values are further.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For translate, allows the element to get bigger as it moves closer
            and smaller as it moves further
          </li>
          <li>
            For rotate, the element looks like it's actually rotating rather
            than just shrinking and growing. Also briefly disappears at
            multiples of 90 if element has no depth.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Must be declared first in the transform property, unlike other
          transform functions which can be in any order
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>perspective-origin</code> determines the angle you're looking at
          the element from
          <ul>
            <li>
              Default is centered, so if you move the element you'll see it
              moving relative to you
            </li>
            <li>
              But you can also move the perspective origin, allowing you to look
              around the element
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Rotate
      <ul>
        <li>
          Adds <code>rotateX()</code>, <code>rotateY()</code>,
          <code>rotateZ()</code> and
          <a
            href="https://www.quackit.com/css/functions/css_rotate3d_function.cfm"
            ><code>rotate3D()</code></a
          >
          functions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Scale
      <ul>
        <li>
          Adds <code>scaleZ()</code> and <code>scale3D()</code> which scale the
          element in the z-axis and all 3 at once respectively
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Translate
      <ul>
        <li>
          Adds <code>translateZ()</code> and <code>translate3D()</code> which
          move the element on the z-axis and all 3.
          <code>translateZ()</code> will not do anything without perspective.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Matrix
      <ul>
        <li>
          Also exists as a way to combine really complex transforms together
        </li>
        <li>
          But generally avoided due to poor readability, don't use it unless you
          need it
        </li>
      </ul>

      Let you animate the transition between states of an element rather than
      instantly changing
    </li>
    <li><code>transition</code> is shorthand for:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>transition-property</code> - Determines the CSS property to be
        transitioned (e.g. background-color)
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>transition-duration</code> - Determines how long the transition
        takes from start to finish
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>transition-timing-function</code> - Determines the rate at which
        the transition progresses, has keywords like ease-out/ease-in but can
        also be defined manually
      </li>
      <li>
