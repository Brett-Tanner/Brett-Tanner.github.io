  <article class="w-75">
    <p>
      I have professional experience in web development with Ruby on Rails on
      AWS, and an interest in any and all areas of programming. Though I chose
      to start with web development due to plentiful high-quality free learning
      resources, I would love to get experience in other areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began learning to code in February 2022 with The Odin Project and in
      November 2022 joined KidsUP (my current employer) as an English teacher.
      Shortly after joining the company, I was entrusted with sole
      responsibility for designing, developing and organizing hosting for a new
      event registration site to replace the incumbent Google Forms/Sheets
      arrangement. That site is currently in production use for KidsUP's biggest
      seasonal event of the year, with more than 3 000 bookings expected by the
      end of the event. Since completing that project I have been given
      responsibility for multiple other projects related to modernizing internal
      systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      While solo-developing such an important site has certainly been a valuable
      learning experience, I am currently exploring opportunities to join a more
      traditionally structured development team. If you're interested in hiring
      a full stack web developer with a proven track record of quickly learning
      and improving under pressure, feel free to get in touch!

              I began learning Ruby through The Odin Project in mid-2022, and
              Rails shortly after. My projects for that course gave me
              experience with the individual components of Ruby and Rails like
              the MVC pattern, ActiveRecord and Ruby's 'everything is an object'
              approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              In November of 2022, I brought all these skills and many more I
              had learn on the fly to bear on the
              <a
                href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/ku_registrations.html"
                target="_blank"
                >KidsUP Registration Site</a
              >. Among many other skills, this project required me to develop a
              much deeper understanding of ActiveRecord. Polymorphic
              associations, scopes and associations with custom names all became
              second nature to enable the sometimes convoluted business logic
              linking events, time slots, options and the calculation of a total
              cost for each booking made.
            </p>
            <p>
              New skills I acquired over the course of this project included
              testing with RSpec, using partials to keep my code DRY, creating
              and customizing ActionMailer mailers, creating authorization
              policies with Pundit, adding interactivity/SPA-like islands with
              Stimulus/Turbo (parts of Hotwire) and many more.

              I started learning vanilla CSS in February 2022 with The Odin
              Project, and have used it multiple times a week every week since
              then. Though I've recently begun using frameworks like Boostrap to
              speed up basic styling, I still happily fall back to vanilla CSS
              whenever I need something more complex.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm familiar with responsive design using media queries, Flexbox
              and Grid, and have some familiarity with using transforms,
              transitions and animations to bring a page to life. I'm excited to
              use some of the new features coming to CSS like view transitions
              for a more app-like experience and container queries as an
              extension of media queries.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of frameworks and pre-processors, I made extensive use of
              Bootstrap while styling the
              <a
                href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/ku_registrations.html"
                target="_blank"
                >KidsUP Registration Site</a
              >
              to match the provided Adobe InDesign mockups. I made frequent use
              of components like the accordion and modals to improve UX, notably
              combining turbo-frames and the Bootstrap modal to allow customers
              to preview their full booking details in a modal, then simply
              close that modal to resume editing it without leaving the booking
              page.

              My experience with AWS began around March 2023, when my supervisor
              informed me the I would be responsible for organizing hosting for
              the
              <a
                href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/ku_registrations.html"
                target="_blank"
                >KidsUP Registration Site</a
              >
              in addition to my initial responsibilities. Given that my
              experience with AWS at that point amounted to knowing that it
              existed and was popular, what followed was definitely a bumpy and
              error filled ride. Despite that, as I write this 4 months later,
              the site is currently live and serving customers with no downtime
              to date.
            </p>
            <p>
              After some research I selected AWS Elastic Beanstalk as the main
              hosting provider for the site, as it seemed to have the most
              documentation/StackOverflow questions to help me out and AWS' free
              tier allowed me to reduce costs for what was largely an
              exploratory project to upper management. After wading through
              Amazon's sea of AWS products, our site now utilizes a Postgres RDS
              DB instance and EC2 instance managed by Elastic Beanstalk as the
              main resources, with SES providing automated confirmation and
              update emails, S3 storing/serving large assets like images and
              Route 53 routing traffic from our domain the the Application Load
              Balancer for the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Getting to this stage required a lot of reading documentation, as
              well as trial and error when documentation didn't cover the issues
              I was experiencing. One early issue was the numerous conflicts
              between the EC2 instance's gem versions/dependecies and those my
              app used, as well as finding an obscure issue with one gem not
              correctly giving permissions to its code in production. The first
              required learning about deploy hooks in
              <code>.ebextensions</code>, while the second was eventually solved
              after I found an open Github issue on the gem suggesting that
              rolling it back to a previous version resolved the permissions
              issue. Integrating S3 and SES were significantly less frustrating,
              but still involved processes which required a lot of reading to
              understand how best to utilize the AWS SDK gems for those services
              in the context of our site.

          <p>
            I use an M1 MacBook Air for development when working from a school,
            and WSL2 when working from home. Between those two and needing to
            use bash for SSH to our EC2 instance, I'm familiar with simple
            commands like <code>tail</code>, <code>cat</code>,
            <code>mkdir</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>htop</code> and similar.
            I'm also very familiar with many of Rails, <code>rbenv</code> and
            <code>bundler</code>'s command line tools. I'm aware there's a whole
            world of useful commands to improve my productivity by learning
            here, and look forward to doing so in the future.

          <h5><i class="devicon-git-plain pe-2"></i>Git</h5>
          <p>
            I'm very comfortable with basic Git usage like staging, committing,
            pushing, pulling and managing branches using the command line. I
            also have some experience with merging, rebasing, managing pull
            requests, and using <code>git reset</code> to fix errors with a
            detached head, though those are skills which could definitely use
            some more development.

            VSCode
          </h5>
          <p>
            I've used VSCode since I started learning to code, and have picked
            up a wide variety of useful shortcuts to improve my productivity,
            from my early discovery of multiple cursors to using
            <kbd>shift+tab</kbd> to remove large blocks of leading whitespace
            rather than manually creating a million cursors and mashing
            backspace. This is another area with seemingly infinite tricks to
            learn, and lately I've been trying to integrate a new shortcut into
            my workflow every few days in an attempt to continue improving.

            WSL2
          </h5>
          <p>
            WSL2 has been a huge boon for my development journey, as when I
            first started I only had access to a Windows laptop, obviously not
            ideal given that a lot of tools/languages (like Ruby/Rails) either
            don't run or work poorly on Windows. WSL allowed me to learn things
            I otherwise couldn't have with just that laptop, and the (in the
            beginning at least) complete reliance on using the command line
            without any GUI definitely polished my skills in that regard. I can
            now say I'm comfortable with setting up a Rails dev environment on
            both Mac and (WSL) Ubuntu, and I actually wrote an internal wiki
            page on the latter.

              I have some familiarity with the basics of vanilla JS (things on
              the level of <code>.querySelectorAll</code> and the different
              variables/comparison operators), but am a bit rusty on anything
              beyond that after mostly using Hotwire for 6 months while working
              on the registration site.

              Now that I'm just making changes and adding features to that site,
              I plan to brush up on JS and pick up The Odin Project where I left
              off, right at the start of Advanced Javascript. Hopefully that
              will give me a working knowledge of the finer points of the
              language, as well as how to use React, and if all goes to plan
              I'll leverage that freshly gained knowledge (and probably some
              further research on Impact.js) into making an educational games
              site for KidsUP students.

              launched, but I plan to create comprehensive docs for both the
              backend of the site and its hosting setup. They'll be presented as
              a static site built with Astro and the Starlight template.

          When I was hired, KidsUP was using a combination of Google Forms and
          Sheets to handle online reservations for their seasonal events. While
          it worked, making a large number of bookings was an incredibly
          cumbersome experience for customers, and the Sheet school managers
          used to track those registrations would take several minutes to load,
          then a few more to become interactive.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was tasked with finding a more user-friendly way for customers to
          register for multiple activities/options and a way of displaying those
          registrations to school managers in a timely manner. After presenting
          an early prototype to the company's CEO, I was given the go-ahead to
          turn it into a full site, with the aim of having it ready to use by
          mid-May for Summer School.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was responsible for nearly all aspects of this project from start to
          finish, including but not limited to the initial design of the
          database, writing and testing all backend code, coding and styling the
          views and deciding on/setting up hosting on AWS. Translations and
          guidance on detailed business logic were provided by other members of
          the online team, but ultimately implemented by me. The project was
          delivered on schedule, and is currently in production use for the
          largest seasonal event of the year.
