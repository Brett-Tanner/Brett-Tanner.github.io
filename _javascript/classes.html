    Classes are a type of special function which serve as templates for creating
    objects. They can have static (class) or instance, as well as public/private
    methods. Methods are defined on the prototype of each instance and are
    shared by all instances. Fields can be declared without <code>let</code> or
    <code>const</code> as they're more like properties on an object than
    variables.

    <h1 id="constructor">Constructor</h1>

    <p>
      A special method for instantiating an object created with a class. Can
      only be one constructor in a class. You can use <code>super</code> to call
      the constructor of a parent class.

    <h1 id="private">Private Fields</h1>

    <p>
      Private fields are declared prefixed with a hash (#). Like in Ruby, they
      can only be read or written within the class body. They can only be
      declared up-front in a field declaration, and can't be created later by
      assigning to them after the object is instantiated.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>extends</code> keyword is used to create a class as a child of
      another constructor, like <code>class Dog extends Animal</code>. If
      there's a constructor in the child class it needs to call
      <code>super()</code> and pass the params required by the parent
      constructor before using <code>this</code>. <code>super()</code> can also
      be used to call corresponding methods of the parent class like
      <code>super.method()</code>
    </p>

    <h1 id="getters_setters">Getters and Setters</h1>

    <p>
      These are class methods which, when called from outside the class, just
      look like accessing a property which shares their name rather than calling
      a function. For example, the seasonal site uses a setter for both parents
      and children to combine the two name fields into a full name which is
      persisted in the DB. They can be defined with <code>get(){}</code> or
      <code>set(){}</code>.
    </p>

  <article>
    <h1 id="static">Static</h1>

    <p>
      <code>static</code> methods/fields are the equivalent of a class
      method/variable in Ruby; they're defined on the class itself rather than
      an instance.
