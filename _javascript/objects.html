    <h1 id="constructors">Object Constructors</h1>

    <p>
      Rather than creating objects with the object literal syntax, for
      frequently used objects it's often preferable to use an object
      constructor. A regular function which takes the values to be assigned to
      that object's keys, but is called by prepending <code>new</code> to the
      method call. Constructors are capitalized by convention, like classes in
      Ruby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently it's possible to define constructors using
      <code>class</code> rather than <code>function</code>, might be easier for
      me to read/remember. But you have to define a
      <code>constructor</code> method on the class, methods can still be
      inherited from that constructor's prototype.
    </p>
    <pre>
function Player(name, marker) {
    this.name = name
    this.marker = marker
}
const player = new Player('steve', 'X')
console.log(player.name) // 'steve'
    </pre>

    <h3>Prototypes</h3>

    <p>
      Prototypes are another object which your object inherits from, gaining all
      of the prototype's method and properties. You can find the prototype of an
      object by calling <code>Object.getPrototypeOf(yourObject)</code>, which
      will be equal to the <code>.prototype</code> property of its constructor.
      It's generally best practice to define method for the object on the
      prototype rather than as part of the constructor, as they are then
      inherited rather than a new method being created in memory for each
      object.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>.hasOwnProperty(propertyName)</code> can be called on an object to
      see if the passed property was initially defined on that object (returns
      true) or inherited from a parent (returns false).
    </p>
    <p>
      Objects can only directly inherit from a single prototype, but you can
      chain inheritances for (presumably) as long as you want. You can safely
      overwrite method on the prototype by defining them on the child object,
      the engine will just find them there an not go looking on the prototype.
      <code>this</code> in a prototype will always refer to the object it's
      being called on, not the one the prototype is defined on.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use <code>Object.setPrototypeOf(toBeSet, setToThis)</code> to set
      an object's prototype. Using a constructor for inheritance can be a bad
      idea when you're going to create a whole bunch of the object, because it
      creates new references to the method in memory for each object and can
      thus use a lot of memory. Prototypes alleviate this by having the method
      all be on the prototype, so only one copy. But constructors let you use
      closure to have "private" variables on your object.
    </p>
    <pre>
function Person(name) {
this.name = name
}

Person.prototype.sayName = function() {
console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.name}!`)
}

function Player(name, marker) {
this.name = name
this.marker = marker
}

Player.prototype.getMarker = function() {
console.log(`My marker is '${this.marker}'`)
}

// Object.getPrototypeOf(Player.prototype) should
// return the value of "Person.prototype" instead
// of "Object.prototype"
Object.getPrototypeOf(Player.prototype) // returns Object.prototype

// Now make `Player` objects inherit from `Person`
Object.setPrototypeOf(Player.prototype, Person.prototype)
Object.getPrototypeOf(Player.prototype) // returns Person.prototype

const player1 = new Player('steve', 'X')
const player2 = new Player('also steve', 'O')

player1.sayName() // Hello, I'm steve!
player2.sayName() // Hello, I'm also steve!

player1.getMarker() // My marker is 'X'
player2.getMarker() // My marker is 'O'
    </pre>
    <p>
      <code>Object.create(prototypeName)</code> will instantiate an object with
      its prototype set to the provided prototype (prototype can just be an
      object assigned to a variable).
    </p>
    <p>
      If iterating over an object's properties, you can exclude/do other stuff
      inherited properties using the return of
      <code>.hasOwnProperty(property)</code>.

    <h3>In Function Invocations</h3>

    <p>
      Without strict mode, refers to the global object (<code>window</code> in
      browsers). In strict mode, will be undefined when called in a regular
      function. If you want to change the context (and thus the value of
      <code>this</code>), you need to specify the context, for example by
      passing it as a parameter like the code below.
    </p>
    <pre>
const numbers = {
    numberA: 5,
    numberB: 10,
    sum: function() {
        console.log(this === numbers); // => true
    
        function calculate() {
        console.log(this === numbers); // => true
        return this.numberA + this.numberB;
        }
    
        // use .call() method to modify the context
        return calculate.call(this);
    }
};
numbers.sum(); // => 15
    </pre>
    <p>
      Or just use an arrow function, in which case <code>this</code> would just
      be the numbers.sum() method.
    </p>

    <h3>In Method Invocations</h3>

    <p>
      <code>this</code> is the object which owns the method. However if
      separated from its object (for example being stored in a variable then
      called independently), <code>this</code> will be the
      <code>window</code> unless bound with <code>.bind(object).</code>
    </p>

    <h3>In Constructor Invocations</h3>

    <p>
      Will be the newly constructed object. Only way it won't is if you forget
      <code>new</code> when invoking the constructor, then
      <code>this</code> will be the window again.
    </p>

    <h3>In Indirect Invocations</h3>

    <p>
      Will be the context passed to <code>.call()</code> or
      <code>.apply()</code>.
