    <code>tsc</code> from the root directory of the project.

    <h1 id="classes">Classes</h1>

    <p>
      Methods on a class are handled just like functions by TS. Inside the
      method body you <strong>must</strong> use <code>this</code> to access
      fields and other methods.
    </p>

    <h3>Accessors</h3>

    <p>TypeScript has some special inference rules for accessors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If get exists but no set, the property is automatically readonly</li>
      <li>
        If the type of the setter parameter is not specified, it is inferred
        from the return type of the getter
      </li>
      <li>Getters and setters must have the same Member Visibility</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Constructor</h3>

    <p>
      Constructors can be overloaded like any other function to allow multiple
      different arrangements of parameters. They can't have type parameters,
      those need to be defined on the outer class declaration, and can't have a
      return type since it's always an instance of the class.
    </p>

    <h3>Fields</h3>
    <p>
      You can declare fields with a type annotation in the usual way, or with a
      default value which will then lead to the type being inferred. They can
      also be prefixed with <code>readonly</code>, which prevents them being
      assigned outside the constructor.
    </p>

    <h3>Inheritance</h3>

    <p>
      You can check a class satisfies a particular interface using
      <code>implements</code>. A class can implement multiple interfaces, and
      will issue an error if any of them aren't matched.
    </p>

    <pre>
interface Pingable {
    ping(): void;
}

class Sonar implements Pingable {
    ping() {
        console.log("ping!");
    }
}

class Ball implements Pingable {
Class 'Ball' incorrectly implements interface 'Pingable'.
Property 'ping' is missing in type 'Ball' but required in type 'Pingable'.

    pong() {
        console.log("pong!");
    }
}
    </pre>

    <p>
      Remember an implements clause is only a check that the class can be
      treated as the interface type, it doesn't actually change anything about
      the class or its methods/fields. You need to apply the implements check
      separately to the class definition and its types.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inherited methods can be overwritten, but if they take a different form
      than the one in the original class the original should be made available
      through <code>super</code> with a conditional.
    </p>

    <h3>Member Visibility</h3>

    <p>
      Like other aspects of TS's type checking system, member visibility is only
      enforced during type checking. If you want to actually make a member
      private, use JS's # at the front of the declaration.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>public</code></dt>
      <dd>
        This is the case by default, and allows the member to be accessed from
        anywhere. You can declare it if you want, but it's unnecessary.
      </dd>
      <dt><code>protected</code></dt>
      <dd>
        Only visible to subclasses of the class they're declared on. Note that
        unless the derived class repeats the protected annotation, anything
        inherited will be public by default.
      </dd>
      <dt><code>private</code></dt>
      <dd>
        Visible only to the class itself, not event derived classes. Therefore
        their visibility can't be increased through a derived class, as not even
        the derived class can see the member. TS allows cross-instance private
        member access for instances of the same class.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      <code>static</code> members can also use public, protected and private ,
      and are inherited.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h1 id="functions">Functions</h1>

    <p>
      You can annotate the type of a function's return value by adding the
      annotation after the function parameters. When it's obvious from context
      what type the params of a function should have, it'll be inferred. For
      example, when iterating over an array of strings with
      <code>.forEach()</code> the param's type will be inferred as string.
    </p>

    <p>
      The simplest way to describe a function is with a function type
      expression.
    </p>
    <pre>
function greeter(fn: (a: string) => void) {
    fn("Hello, World");
}
    
function printToConsole(s: string) {
console.log(s);

// Shorter syntax with a type alias
type GreetFunction = (a: string) => void;
function greeter(fn: GreetFunction) {
  // ...
}
}

greeter(printToConsole);
    </pre>

    <p>
      However this doesn't allow you to declare properties on the function. For
      that, you need a call signature. Note the ':' between the params and
      return type rather than '=>'.
    </p>

    <pre>
type DescribableFunction = {
    description: string;
    (someArg: number): boolean;
};
    </pre>

    <p>
      If you want to declare a constructor, use the construct signature by
      placing a <code>new</code> in front of the call signature. If the function
      can also be called as a regular non-constructor function (like
      <code>Date()</code>) you can have both construct and call signatures in
      the same type/interface.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h1 id="generics">Generics</h1>

    <p>
      If you want to relate the input of a function to its output, you can use
      generic types. For example, the following will return a string if passed
      an array of strings, number if passed an array of numbers, or undefined if
      passed an empty array.
    </p>

    <pre>
function firstElement< Type >(arr: Type[]): Type | undefined {
    return arr[0];
}
// This can also be done with multiple parameters
function map< Input, Output >(arr: Input[], func: (arg: Input) => Output): Output[] {
    return arr.map(func);
  }
   
  // Parameter 'n' is of type 'string'
  // 'parsed' is of type 'number[]'
  const parsed = map(["1", "2", "3"], (n) => parseInt(n));
    </pre>

    <p>
      To declare a function which can be called with a wide variety of different
      parameters, use function overloads by declaring the function with its
      possible parameters multiple times consecutively, followed by the body of
      the function.
    </p>

    <pre>
function makeDate(timestamp: number): Date;
function makeDate(m: number, d: number, y: number): Date;
function makeDate(mOrTimestamp: number, d?: number, y?: number): Date {
  if (d !== undefined && y !== undefined) {
    return new Date(y, mOrTimestamp, d);
  } else {
    return new Date(mOrTimestamp);
  }
}
    </pre>

    <p>
      The final declaration is the implementation signature, which
      <strong>must</strong> be compatible with the overload signatures.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h1 id="interfaces">Interfaces</h1>

    <p>
      Interfaces are a way to define types for an object. You can also declare
      these with <code>type</code>, but general approach is to use
      <code>interface</code> until you need the features provided by
      <code>type</code>. They're declared and used like objects, with optional
      properties marked by a ?, as follows:
    </p>

    <pre>
interface Point {
    x: number;
    y: number;
    z?: number;
}

function printCoord(pt: Point) {
    console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
    console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}

printCoord({ x: 100, y: 100 });
    </pre>

    <p>
      If you need to set default values for optional properties of an interface,
      you can use a destructuring pattern like
      <code>{ shape, xPos = 0, yPos = 0 }: PaintOptions</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Properties marked <code>readonly</code> can't be written to during type
      checking, but its behavior at runtime won't be affected. Note this doesn't
      make the property immutable, for example if the property itself is an
      object you can still update its properties. You just can't directly write
      to the <code>readonly</code> property.
    </p>

    <h3>Extending Types</h3>

    <p>
      If you have two object which share properties but one is more detailed,
      you can extend the simpler object to create the more complex one without
      repeating definitions like:
    </p>

    <pre>
interface BasicAddress {
    name?: string;
    street: string;
    city: string;
    country: string;
    postalCode: string;
}
    
interface AddressWithUnit extends BasicAddress {
    unit: string;
}
    </pre>

    <p>
      It's possible to extend from multiple types by separating them with a
      comma. Alternatively, if you just want to create a new type that's a
      combination of existing ones you can use the intersection syntax.
    </p>

    <pre>
interface Colorful {
    color: string;
}

interface Circle {
    radius: number;
}
    
type ColorfulCircle = Colorful & Circle;
    </pre>

    <p>
      If you have a bunch of objects where the only difference is the types the
      can accept, you can use
    </p>

    <pre>
interface Box< Type > {
    contents: Type;
}
    </pre>

    <p>
      then create the object with <code>let box: Box< string >;</code> or
      whatever that desired type for that instance is. Array typing
      (<code>string[]</code>) is an example of this, the [] is just an
      abstraction.
    </p>

    <h3>Index Signatures</h3>

    <p>
      If you don't know what the properties of an object will be called ahead of
      time, you can define them as a type like [index: number]. Only
      <code>number</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>symbol</code>, template
      strings and union types consisting of only these are acceptable here.
    </p>

    <p>
      One issue is an index signature requires all properties to have the same
      return value type. You can solve this by specifying the return value type
      as a union.
    </p>

    <h3>Tuples</h3>

    <p>
      An array type that knows exactly how many elements it contains and which
      types are at specific positions, e.g.
      <code>type StringNumberPair = [string, number];</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      Tuples can have optional parameters (declared with ? as usual), but they
      must come at the end and will change the <code>length</code> type of the
      tuple to be a union of possible lengths with/without the optional param.
    </p>

    <p>And rest elements, which must be an array or tuple type</p>

    <pre>
type StringNumberBooleans = [string, number, ...boolean[]];
type StringBooleansNumber = [string, ...boolean[], number];
type BooleansStringNumber = [...boolean[], string, number];
    </pre>

    <ul>
      <li>
        StringNumberBooleans describes a tuple whose first two elements are
        string and number respectively, but which may have any number of
        booleans following.
      </li>
      <li>
        StringBooleansNumber describes a tuple whose first element is string and
        then any number of booleans and ending with a number.
      </li>
      <li>
        BooleansStringNumber describes a tuple whose starting elements are any
        number of booleans and ending with a string then a number.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h1 id="narrowing">Narrowing</h1>

    <p>
      Obvious types of narrowing are if statements or switches with
      <code>typeof</code>. But JS also provides <code>in</code> and
      <code>instanceOf</code>, which can be used to select objects with a
      property matching teh value given and see if an object is an instance of
      another value respectively.
    </p>

    <pre>
// in
type Fish = { swim: () => void };
type Bird = { fly: () => void };
type Human = { swim?: () => void; fly?: () => void };
    
function move(animal: Fish | Bird | Human) {
    if ("swim" in animal) {
    animal;
        
(parameter) animal: Fish | Human
    } else {
    animal;
        
(parameter) animal: Bird | Human
    }
}

// instanceOf
function logValue(x: Date | string) {
    if (x instanceof Date) {
      console.log(x.toUTCString());
                 
  (parameter) x: Date
    } else {
      console.log(x.toUpperCase());
                 
  (parameter) x: string
    }
  }
    </pre>

    <p>
      TS allows you to check if the return of a function is one of your defined
      types using type predicates. For example
    </p>
    <pre>
function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {
    return (pet as Fish).swim !== undefined;
}
    </pre>
    <p>will check the returned value is an instance of Fish.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h1 id="types">Types</h1>

    <p>
      When creating a variable in TS, its type will be inferred from the initial
      value is one is provided. Can be manually annotated like
      <code>let variable: number = 42</code>; params passed to functions can be
      annotated the same way. Optional parameters should have a '?' appended.
    </p>

    <p>
      Type assertions allow you to specify a more or less specific version of a
      type, by appending <code>as specificType</code> to the code.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>any</code></dt>
      <dd>
        Used when you don't want a particular value to raise any type-checking
        errors. But avoid it unless really necessary, kinda defeats the point of
        TS.
      </dd>
      <dt>Arrays</dt>
      <dd>
        You can specify the type for all elements in an array like
        <code>number[]</code> or <code>string[]</code>.
      </dd>
      <dt><code>Function</code></dt>
      <dd>
        Can always be called, describes properties like <code>bind</code>,
        <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code>. Has a default return type of
        <code>any</code>, so best to specify the return type manually.
      </dd>
      <dt><code>null/undefined</code></dt>
      <dd>
        With strict mode on, which I should always have, you must check for
        null/undefined values in the function. Putting ? in a chain will only
        make the call if not null or undefined, it'll fizzle the chain to
        <code>undefined</code> rather than throwing an error. Remember
        <code>typeof null == object</code>, so you also need to check if the
        object is truthy like
        <code>if (object && typeof object == "object")</code>.
      </dd>
      <dt><code>object</code></dt>
      <dd>
        anything that's not a primitive, including function values. Different
        from the empty object type and the global type <code>Object</code>
      </dd>
      <dt><code>string, number, boolean</code></dt>
      <dd>Same as the primitives in JS</dd>
      <dt><code>unknown</code></dt>
      <dd>
        Like <code>any</code> can represent any value, but safer because it's
        not legal to do anything with an <code>unknown</code> value.
      </dd>
      <dt><code>void</code></dt>
      <dd>
        Represents the return value of functions which don't return a value.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>never</h3>

    <p>
      You can use the <code>never</code> type for exhaustiveness checking, to
      make sure you cover all possibilities in a switch or conditional. Assign a
      variable with that type annotated in the else or default block and if that
      block is reached an error will be raised. No error will be raised if all
      possible cases are handled.
    </p>

    <pre>
interface Triangle {
    kind: "triangle";
    sideLength: number;
}
    
type Shape = Circle | Square | Triangle;

function getArea(shape: Shape) {
switch (shape.kind) {
    case "circle":
        return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    case "square":
        return shape.sideLength ** 2;
    default:
        const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape;
Type 'Triangle' is not assignable to type 'never'.

    return _exhaustiveCheck;
}
}
    </pre>

    <p>
      Functions can be declared to take an unlimited number of parameters of a
      certain type with rest parameters of the form <code>...n: number[]</code>.
      They will always use the <code>something[]</code> notation.
    </p>

    <h3>this</h3>

    <p>
      You can declare the context of <code>this</code> by annotating it like a
      parameter in the function declaration.
    </p>

    <h3>Union Types</h3>

    <p>
      An annotation allowing one of a group of types. Types are separated by a
      single pipe, like <code>string | number</code>. TS will then only allow
      operators valid for both types in the union to be called on that value, so
      if you need to call something that only works on one of the types you'll
      need to narrow using <code>typeof</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Union types can be used with literal types to create something like an
      enum in Ruby, where only the literal types in the Union type will be
      allowed. For example,
      <code
        >function printText(s: string, alignment: "left" | "right" | "center")
        {}</code
      >. Literal types and non-literal types can be combined in the same union.
    </p>

    <p>
      Annotating a literal type, then later calling that function with a string
      from an object passed can still throw an error, as that string could be
      anything. So you have to annotate <code>as const</code> to convert the
      whole object to literals, or appending <code>as literal</code> to the
      property itself.
