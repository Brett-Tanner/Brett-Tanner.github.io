    <h1 id="components">Components</h1>

    <p>
      Components are self contained functions which return chunks of HTML. They
      can be passed props, and render other components inside them. The App
      component is the root component of the app which all others are rendered
      inside. The component function should be capitalized.
    </p>

    <p>
      Returning <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code> and false will cause
      nothing to be rendered, while other falsy values like 0 or empty strings
      will be rendered.
    </p>

    <h3>Hooks</h3>

    <p>
      Always start with 'use'. Can only be called from the top level of a
      functional component, and not within a loop or conditional.
    </p>

    <h4 class="font-bold">STATE SHOULD ALWAYS BE IMMUTABLE</h4>

    <p>
      If you're updating an object or array in state, separate it out with the
      spread operator and overwrite the stuff you want to change, then return
      the new object rather than editing the existing one.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you call setState(state + 1) twice in a row, it'll only increment by 1
      since the stored state is used for both (and replaced, not updated). If
      you want to update it, use an updater callback like
      <code
        >setPerson((prevPerson) => ({ ...prevPerson, age: prevPerson.age + 1
        }));</code
      >
    </p>

    <h3>Keys</h3>

    <p>
      Keys are used to uniquely identify sibling elements of the same type
      during re-renders. The
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid">UUID package</a> can be used
      to create unique ids if you're not working with a DB that provides them.
      Make sure you set the keys outside the component, if you set them in the
      JSX itself it'll be re-rendered each time which defeats the point.
    </p>

    <p>
      Indexes as keys are
      <a href="https://www.developerway.com/posts/react-key-attribute"
        >usually a bad idea</a
      >, but in some situations can lead to better performance without the
      drawbacks. For example a paginated list where the components don't have
      state, it's faster to just use the index as a key so the components can
      just have their contents replaced, rather than being unmounted and new
      components mounted.
    </p>

    <h3>Props</h3>

    <p>
      Props can be destructured by using an object with the names of the props
      you want as the param of the component function (like
      <code>Button({ text, classes })</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Default props can be set by setting the defaultProps property of the
      component. It's also possible to combine destructuring and default props
      like <code>Button({ text = "Click Me!", classes = "text-lg" })</code>.

    <h1 id="jsx">JSX</h1>

    <p>
      JSX is a filetype that lets you write HTML-like markup in a JS file. Use
      curly braces ({}) to embed JS expressions or variables, but only as text
      directly inside a JSX tag or as attributes immediately following an '='.
    </p>

    <h3>JSX Rules</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Return a single root element</dt>
      <dd>
        If you want to return multiple elements, wrap them in a div or a
        <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment">React Fragment</a>
      </dd>
      <dt>Close all tags</dt>
      <dd>Tags that're self-closing in HTML aren't in JSX</dd>
      <dt>camelCase <em>most</em> things</dt>
      <dd>
        Because JSX turns into JS, you can't use stuff like class or '-' which
        you usually would in HTML. So class becomes className and other stuff is
        camel cased. <code>aria</code> and <code>data</code> attributes are
        written with dashes as in HTML for historic reasons.
